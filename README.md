Instructions: The game should work fine from the start but it'll start right away. 

General instructions
-------------------------------
  - Up: [up button] or W
  - Down: [down button] or S
  - Left: [left button] or A
  - Right: [right button] or D
  - Interact/Talk: Z
  - (some dialogues will involve using the mouse to select options for the player's response, so 

In-Battle
------------------------------- 
  - Use your mouse to click on the icons in battle and select the move you would like to perform.
  - For minigames, use UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT to move around or SPACE to time accuracy moves.

Bugs
--------------------------------
- Colliding with a teleporter from one room to the next horizontally does not always work. For context, vertically (moving from one room to the next as the character moves from up to down or vice versa) works normally, but we seem to be horizontally challenged.
- Item button and run buttons don't do anything at the moment, as they are placeholders. Not necessarily a bug, just not fully implemented yet.
To our knowledge, there are no known bugs in this project, but there is a lot of ground to cover in a game like this one so though we have tested and found nothing ourselves, it may not be perfect. Please let us know.
